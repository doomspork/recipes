  - "Heat a large braiser or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add avocado oil, then sear beef in batches (don't overcrowd) for 3 minutes per side until browned. Set aside."
  - "Add onion to the pan, deglazing with a splash of broth if needed. Sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes."
  - "Push onions aside and add tomato paste. Stir for 1-2 minutes until fragrant and deeper red."
  - "Return beef to pan. Add onion soup mix, 4 cups beef broth, and water. Stir in browning sauce if using. Taste and adjust salt."
  - "Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to medium. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally."
  - "Remove lid and continue simmering until meat is tender and begins to fall apart. Sauce should reduce to a thick gravy. Add remaining broth if too dry. Increase heat to medium-high for a final simmer, then serve."
