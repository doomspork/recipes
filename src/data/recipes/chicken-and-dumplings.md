directions:
  - "Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Place the chicken cubes in the bottom, and cook for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the chicken from the pot, and set aside."
  - "Turn the heat to medium, and add in the butter. Once the butter has melted, add in the onion and carrots. Sauté for about 3 minutes, or until the onions are just starting to turn translucent."
  - "Add in the garlic and stir. Sauté for another minute, or until aromatic."
  - "Sprinkle in the flour and stir until the butter and flour are well combined (making sure no large lumps form)."
  - "Add the chicken and its juices back into the pot. Mix so that the chicken gets coated in the flour mixture."
  - "Mix together the chicken broth and milk in a large liquid measuring cup. Slowly pour in the chicken broth and milk mixture while stirring. Sprinkle in the dried thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer."
  - "While the soup is simmering, make the dumplings. In a medium bowl, combine the Bisquick, milk, and poultry seasoning. Stir until just combined."
  - "Drop the dumpling dough by spoonfuls into the simmering soup. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, or until the dumplings are cooked through."
