directions:
  - "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whisk together the warm water, yeast, and brown sugar. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes until foamy."
  - "Add the salt, melted butter, and 3 cups of flour. Beat on low for 1 minute, scrape down the sides, then add 3/4 cup more flour. Beat until the dough pulls away from the sides, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup flour if the dough is extremely sticky."
  - "Switch to the dough hook and knead for 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky. Cover with a towel and let rest for 10-30 minutes."
  - "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats."
  - "Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 20-inch rope (if the dough shrinks back, let it rest for 10 minutes). Cut each rope into 1.5-2 inch pieces."
  - "Bring the 9 cups of water and baking soda to a boil in a large pot. Working in batches of 8-10, boil the pretzel bites for 10-15 seconds. Remove with a slotted spatula, drain, and place on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with coarse salt while still wet."
  - "Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown. Serve warm with cheese sauce or mustard."
